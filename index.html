MRM is one of the five teams from India to be selected, along with teams from IIT Bombay, VIT Vellore, SRM University, and IIT Madras. Mars Rover Manipal is very excited since the declaration of the results and is working even harder. The rover for URC 2018 is named ‘Airawat’. The rover is capable of performing tasks such as autonomous traversal, extreme retrieval, equipment servicing and soil collection and testing amongst others. A team of 20 members have travelled to USA to represent Manipal Academy of Higher Education (MAHE) on the big stage. The team was ranked Asia's best team in URC 2017 with a worldwide position of 8. MRM also won the inaugural Indian Rover Challenge, held in January 2018.
